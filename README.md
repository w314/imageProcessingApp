The app provides resized images from the images in its image store.

## Installation
- clone repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/w314/imageProcessingApp.git
```
- install dependecies
```shell
npm install
```
- start project
```shell
npm start
```

## How to use the app

- Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000/api/images
The project is setup to start with running `index.js` under the `dist` folder. Currently there is no such file and directory running `npm start` throws an error.

Runnig `npm run build` first would create the directory and file to start the app. 
```shell
npm run build
npm start

```
